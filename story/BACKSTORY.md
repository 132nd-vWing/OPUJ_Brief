## SITUATION

Tension in the Caucasus region are at an all-time high following Russia's open support to the Abkhazian republic and its declaration of independence from Georgia. The international community is divided, with USA and the most of the United Nations on one side of the conflict - in support of Georgia's claim to the region - and Russia, China, Venezuela, Syria and Iran amongst others supporting Abkhazia's independence. Some countries, in particular Turkey, India and Armenia have yet to openly declare support for either side of the conflict. The fact that Turkey has yet to support Georgia in its claims is viewed as a serious concern and a notable change from previous escalations. Turkey has also made it clear that it intends to stay neutral and will not support any intervention or military action from either side of the conflict. This is expected to include use of their airspace and territorial waters.

While various State actors - led by the United States and Russia in particular - have been engaged in a war of words for some time, no external factions are currently engaged in any confirmed direct on-the-ground involvement has of yet. However, there are growing concerns on both sides of the table regarding the possibility of human rights violations and war crimes as seen in the conflict of 1992-1998 as the conflict escalates, with russia increasing their rhetorics around their self-proclaimed right to defend any russian ethnicity regardless of geography. This, against the backdrop of the Ukrainian conflict of recent years, has led to both the [UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations) and [OSCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe) deploying observers to the region. Russia has stated that they are in the process of sending their own delegation of observers as well.

On a military level, there are reports of increased milliary activity on the russian side of the border and in South Ossetia, as well as troop movements trough Russia in the direction of the Caucasus region. There are serious concerns that Russia will in fact invade under the guise of liberating its people, while in reality is looking to greatly improve its position in the region as well as control the oil pipelines going trough the northern part of Georgia. Analysts are speculating that this could be the second step in a plan to control the oil coming in over land to Europe, as this is the same pipeline they now control following the Ukrainian campaign, and controlling its passage trough Georgia would prevent any re-routing of the oil across the Black Sea or trough Turkey.

In view of this, western leaders have joined together to form a multinational taskforce with the immediate goal to balance the military power in the region, support the secure the safety of international observers and deter any further escalation of the conflict. 

### COALITION TASK FORCE (NAME OF TASKFORCE)

(NAME OF TASKFORCE) is a multinational taskforce with significant capabilities both on land, in the air and at sea. The intent is to bring a large and capable force into the region to deter, stabilize, but also to fight should the need be. Western military and political leaders have identified the need to show willingness to meet russia's newer aggressive stance and will to invade neighboring country in a different matter than what was shown during the Ukrainian campaign. There is also an eagerness to push Russia out of the contested regions as well as the near-border areas - reducing political influence and eliminating any military presence.

#### Current Directives:
1. Establish a presence in order to deter escalation by any party or faction
2. Support international observers currently in the region

#### Potential Directives - Escalation:
1. Attrit and degrade Russian military assets and will to fight in the Caucasus region
2. Attrit and degrade separatists assets and will to fight in the Caucasus region
3. Restore borders
4. Create buffer zones and establish a presence of international observers in the Caucasus region



## LOCAL PROXIES

### [ABKHAZIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abkhazia)
- Capital: Sukhumi
- Military and Security Forces: Abkhazia Armed Forces (AAF, separatists), Russian Military Forces, Mercenaries
- Demographics: 51% Abkhaz, ?% Armenian, ?% Georgian, ?% Russian, ?% Other
- Religion: 60% Christian (Eastern Orthodox), 16% Muslim (Sunni), 24% Other

The status of Abkhazia is a central issue in the region and despite the 1994 ceasefire agreement and years of negotiations, the dispute remain unresolved. However, following the Russian Prime Minister openly giving his support to its independence in the UN Council, Abhkazia announced its independence on May the 14th, 2020 - exactly 26 years since the signing of the 1994 Moscow Agreement. This in turn significantly sours relations between Russia and countries supporting Georgia's claim to the region, as well as turning the region into a flashpoint for armed conflict.

Unfortunately there is no shortage of reasons to fuel the conflict, as attempts to tilt the political balance in favor of the various internal demographics leads to new religious tensions in a region already fraught with ethnical and historical conflict. In particular, the ruling Abkhaz's move to absorb significant amounts of Syrian (Sunni) refugees of mainly Abkhaz ancestry is believed to increase the religious aspect of the conflict.
  
### [SOUTH OSSETIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Ossetia)
- Capital: Tskhinvali
- Military and Security Forces: South Ossetia Armed Forces (SOAF, separatists), Russian Military Forces, Mercenaries
- Demographics: 90% Ossetian, 7,5% Georgian, 1% Russian, 1.5% Other (2015)
- Religion: Christian (Eastern Orhodox)

South Ossetia, officially the Republic of South Ossetia, is a part of what is considered Georgian territory by most members of the United Nations. South Ossetia has however had a greater degree of autonomy and is, following the Russo-Georgian War (2008) where Ossetian and Russian forces gained full control of the territory, considered by the international community to be occupied by Russian military forces. South Ossetia relies heavily on military, political and financial aid from Russia, and is expected to become a stronghold and possible staging point for Russian forces in any escalation of the current Abkhzian conflict. South Ossetia's armed forces where partially incorporated into the Armed Forces of Russia in 2017.

### [ADJARA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjara)
- Capital: Batumi
- Military and Security Forces: None (Georgian Armed Forces)
- Demographics: 93.5% Georgian (Adjarians), 2.5% Russian, 2.5% Armenians, 1.5% Other
- Religion: 70% Christian (Eastern Orthodox), 27% Muslim (Sunni), 3% Other

Adjara, officially known as the Autonomous Republic of Adjara, is a political-administrative region of Georgia. In contrast to South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Adjara avoided the post-soviet union chaos and civil wars and is one of Georgia's most prosperous regions - enjoying considerable local autonomy. The central government in Tbilisi had very little influence over the region until the 'Rose Revolution' of 2003-2004 that ended with the deposition of Adjara's authoritarian leader resigning and going into exile in Russia.

Since the mid-2000s Turkey has expanded its influence over Adjara. And in 2007 Russia withdrew from their base at Batumi - ending its two centuries long military presence in Georgia. The Turkish influence can be seen in the region's economy and in the religious life - trough the region's Muslim population. It is expected that Adjara will support Georgia in its claims against Abkhazia and its supporters, but the region might become a gateway for religiously motivated combatants and mercenaries coming in from the middle-eastern countries to the south and to the east.
